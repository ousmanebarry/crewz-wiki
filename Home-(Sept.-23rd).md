## What is Crewz

Crewz is a mobile app that helps drivers create, join, and coordinate real life convoys.
The goal is to make group drives safer, more organized, and more fun by offering:

- Live location sharing (only while the convoy is active)

- A shared map that shows all drivers in the group

- Simple communication tools like chat and alerts
