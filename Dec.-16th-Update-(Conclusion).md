## Conclusion

This project successfully delivered a functional minimum viable product (MVP) for **Crewz**, a mobile application designed to support the creation, coordination, and real-time tracking of driving convoys. All core objectives defined earlier in the term were completed and integrated into a cohesive system by mid-December .

The final system includes authenticated user access, a friend connection mechanism, convoy creation and scheduling, and real-time location sharing displayed on a shared map. These features enable users to form convoys, invite participants, and track convoy members throughout an active session using live location updates. Profile customization, including profile picture upload and management, was also implemented and integrated consistently across the application interface .

From a technical perspective, the application adopts a client–server architecture combining a React Native frontend with a Supabase-backed backend. Supabase services were used for authentication, persistent data storage, media storage, and real-time communication, while the Google Maps SDK provided mapping, geolocation, and input validation capabilities. This architecture proved suitable for supporting real-time interaction while maintaining modularity and scalability .

Several potential enhancements—such as in-convoy messaging, additional convoy statistics, and further user interface refinements—were identified but intentionally excluded from the MVP due to time constraints. These features represent logical extensions for future iterations rather than gaps in the current implementation.

In summary, the project achieved its intended scope and produced a complete, functional MVP that demonstrates practical application of mobile development, real-time systems, and backend integration. The remaining effort was dedicated to preparing and structuring the final presentation, with emphasis on architectural decisions, implementation challenges, and system behavior.
