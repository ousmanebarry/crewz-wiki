# Main Functionality complete + update of user search + starting presentation work

The main functionality of the application is now complete. A user can now add friends my searching them up (will only show other user not the user himself). From there, there will be a list of users displayed (with information on users who are friends, user who aren't friends, and user who have a pending friend request).

As an example of the new functionality, Me as User A can now befriend user B, C, and D. From there, once they've all individually accepted my friend requests, I can create a new convoy with all of them in it. I will go to the convoy screen and click on the add convoy button. From there, I will be able to fill in information on the start date/time of the convoy, the starting location, the destination location, and add friend B and D to that convoy. From there, users B and D will receive those invites and all users will have an updated Convoy dashboard (contains info on past, current, and upcoming convoys).

Now, when we reach the starting time/date of the convoy, the convoy will begin. From here all users' locations are broadcasted to every other user location on a shared map (we achieved this functionality using Google Maps SDK as well as supabase's real time channels). Users will be able to now go on drives with their friends until reaching destination location which would mark the end of the convoy ride.

In the next week, we are planning to make small addition if time allows for them. Examples of such improvements/additions ae some UI/frontend refinements, fixing issues relating to user stats on convoys, and maybe even adding a user chatting feature.


The last update is we've started working on our final presentation which will be presented next week on December 17th at 4pm. Currently, we are still in the planning phase of the presentation. We're still figuring out stuff like what slides to add, what not to add, how technical should we go, as well as the general format of it.
